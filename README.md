Introduction

Hi everyone

Thanks for the challenge, it's been a lot of time without doing any Ads implementation so this knowledge refreshment was a great exercise. The integration between Mopub and Unity Ads is really interesting. 
The configuration of Ads in the Mopub platform was a little edgy as it was my first time doing it, at the end I solved the bug by understading well the link between both platforms (Mopub and Unity Ads). 

I didn't have enough time to use the "Dismiss" and "Shown" even provided by the SDK to handle the interstitial states. Still, it shouldn't take me a lot to implement in the future.

Thank you again for the test, I hope it's enough to keep me in the process.

Sincerely,
Andrés
